GitHub Page of documentation useful to MCCE developers. For now, just my personal notes as I work through the code, so please don't expect completeness or polish.

## Style guide

I am working to bring the code into compliance with [this C coding standard](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/%7Eeno/coding/CCodingStandard.html). Future development should abide by these rules to maintain code consistency. 

## Testing suite
There exists a short file called testing.c in the lib directory. It looks like Demetri might have written it.
